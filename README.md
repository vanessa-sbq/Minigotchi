## A brief description

Minigotchi is an implementation of a Tamagotchi that runs on minix. Currently it has the character itself (The Minigotchi) that can be named, fed and cuddled.

There is no way to lose in the actual game (The Minigotchi will not die if he starves or his energy is depleated) as this would turn the game into more of a horror game intead of a happy and friendly one.

There are two minigames, tic tac toe (Multiplayer) and rock paper scissors. Both of these games will reward the player that wins. In the case of rock paper scissors you will be testing your luck agains the computer but in tic tac toe you can play with a friend that also has a minigotchi, just link your computers using the serial port.

Below are some pictures of the gameplay:
